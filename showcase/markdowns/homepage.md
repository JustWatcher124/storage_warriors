## Our Garanty

We Garanty, that Our platform works with your sales data - However complicated you might think it is.

(But, if you give our platform a large dataset it may take literal days to train the models, if the alloted system can even handle this)

### Disclaimer

We don't garanty that we can magically make the impossible possible. We can't tell you if the predictions are accurate in the real world, but they are as close as mathematically possible.

Make sure you trust your data. The Saying: 'Garbage in, Garbage out' holds regardless of how good a model is. If your data contains inconsistencies, it is your responsibility to rectify it.

## Where to Start

#### Just like with all things in life: You have choices:

1. First Choice: Load Your Own Data from files on your system and our system trains the model
2. Second Choice: Load some our own Data that has already a model trained on it and test it
3. Third Choice: Leave (but please leave a tip with us: [Buy Me a Coffee](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ))

The First and Second choice have their own chapters in the navigation pane on the left, please Start your Data Exploration Journey by clicking on one of the pages.
